This project targets users closely connected to the lake and its surrounding environment. The design thoughtfully incorporates natural elements by adopting a predominantly green color scheme to create a visually comfortable and nature-inspired experience. This approach not only aligns with the ecological theme but also fosters an emotional connection between users and the natural setting, enhancing overall engagement.

Given that children are part of the target user group, a dedicated Children’s Mode was developed. This mode is tailored to the cognitive characteristics and usage habits of younger users, featuring an interface layout and interactive activities designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and engaging. By lowering operational complexity and adding playful elements, Children’s Mode encourages active participation and learning. This reflects a user-centered design philosophy, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for users of varying ages.

The overall interface design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, highlighting core functionalities while maintaining attention to detail. Clear visual hierarchy and consistent interaction patterns reduce cognitive load, allowing users with diverse backgrounds and skill levels to navigate the system smoothly. Notably, the map module enables direct interaction with locations, events, and stories through rich multimedia elements, thereby enhancing immersion and cultural understanding. This design effectively transcends traditional text-based information delivery, making cultural content more vivid and approachable.

To respect and preserve New Zealand’s Māori culture, the system includes a bilingual language toggle between Māori and English, allowing users to switch based on personal preference. The default display language is Māori, demonstrating prioritization and reverence for the indigenous culture. This bilingual support promotes language preservation and cultural diversity.

Content management employs permission controls and TK labeling to classify and protect culturally sensitive information. These measures ensure that sensitive content is accessible only within appropriate permission levels, balancing cultural sensitivity with legal compliance. This approach provides a secure and personalized user experience that respects diverse cultural backgrounds.

In summary, through meticulous user experience design and deep cultural integration, this project aims to create a platform that combines modern interaction with cultural heritage preservation. It enhances user engagement and cultural identity while fostering innovative practices in cultural protection and dissemination.
